**Design flow for differential cells**

This repository contains scripts for synthesis and place-and-route using dual-rail domino (DRD) cells.

1. Conventional synthesis with CMOS cells in DC
2. CMOS cell conversion to DRD variants with Python script
3. Differential connection modification in DC
4. Place-and-route with clock mesh insertion in ICC2
