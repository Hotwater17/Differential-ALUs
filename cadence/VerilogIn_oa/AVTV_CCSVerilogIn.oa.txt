Assessment
----------
The testcase in CDBA for VerilogIn, the design data is a verilog netlist (Text file)

The netlist does not requires translation

Testcase used sample and basic library from cadence hierarchy this does not need translation


Validation
----------
After translation of verilog netlist file the functional view is generated having this content on IC5141USR4


***********
// Created by ihdl
module halfadd (X, Y, C, S );
input X, Y; 
output C, S; 
wire S1, S2, S3; 
nand NANDA (S3, X, Y); 
nand NANDB (S1, X, S3); 
nand NANDC (S2, S3, Y); 
nand NANDD (S, S1, S2); 
assign C = S3; 
 
endmodule

****************

The functional view created in IC611 will be verified in the verification step.


Done a schematic check with no error/warning with cross view checking 


Translation
------------
No Data is translated


Verification
------------
The functional view created on IC611
